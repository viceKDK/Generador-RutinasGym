# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Reduce workout routine creation time from 30 minutes to 5 minutes (83% reduction)
- Enable non-technical users (like your mother) to generate professional routines independently
- Generate personalized routines based on client characteristics (gender, age, training days)
- Export professionally formatted Word documents with images and text automatically
- Provide a completely offline, local desktop solution for gym owners
- Eliminate manual formatting and consistency errors in routine documentation

## Background Context

Gym owners and personal trainers currently spend 15-30 minutes manually creating each workout routine, resulting in time loss that could be spent serving clients. The process is repetitive, error-prone, and requires technical knowledge to create professional Word documents with proper formatting and exercise images. Existing online solutions require internet connectivity and often lack the customization needed for personal training businesses.

GymRoutine Generator addresses this gap by providing an ultra-simple desktop application that generates personalized workout routines based on client parameters and exports them to professional Word documents using existing exercise templates as reference material.

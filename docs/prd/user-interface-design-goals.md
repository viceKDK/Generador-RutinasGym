# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The application will embody "grandmother-friendly" design principles with an interface so intuitive that users can accomplish their goals without training. The experience should feel like filling out a simple form and clicking a single "Generate" button, with clear visual feedback at each step. Every element should be large, clearly labeled, and positioned to guide users naturally through the workflow.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Single-screen workflow:** All inputs visible on main screen to avoid navigation confusion
- **Progressive disclosure:** Show only essential options initially, with advanced features hidden
- **Large touch targets:** Buttons and input fields sized for easy clicking (minimum 44px)
- **Immediate feedback:** Visual confirmation for every user action
- **Error prevention:** Input validation with helpful guidance rather than error correction

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Input Screen:** Primary interface with client parameter inputs and generate button
- **Progress Screen:** Simple progress bar with clear status messages during generation
- **Success Screen:** Confirmation of completion with options to open file or create another routine
- **Settings Screen:** Minimal configuration for template folder location and basic preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure usability for users with varying abilities, particularly important given the 50+ age demographic of secondary users.

## Branding
Clean, professional appearance that reflects fitness industry standards. Use of clear typography, high contrast colors, and exercise-related iconography. Avoid technical jargon or complex visual elements that might intimidate non-technical users.

## Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Windows desktop application optimized for mouse and keyboard interaction, with consideration for potential touchscreen use on Windows tablets.

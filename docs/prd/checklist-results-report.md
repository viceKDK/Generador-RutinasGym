## Priority Issues

**HIGH Priority:**
- Define specific performance baselines (startup time, memory usage)
- Complete security and data protection requirements
- Specify exact system requirements for Ollama + Mistral 7B

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- Add user research validation evidence
- Consider MVP scope refinement for faster initial delivery

## Recommendations
1. Add specific hardware requirements (CPU, RAM, storage)
2. Define data privacy and security policies
3. Specify performance benchmarks for various system configurations
4. Consider splitting Epic 1 for faster initial value delivery

**ASSESSMENT: NEARLY READY FOR ARCHITECT** - Address HIGH priority items before proceeding to architecture phase.

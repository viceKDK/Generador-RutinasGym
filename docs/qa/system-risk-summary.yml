    title: 'Ollama AI Service Dependency Failure'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement robust AI fallback algorithm before development'
      - 'Add database corruption recovery mechanisms'
      - 'Design error-resilient Word document generation'
      - 'Establish grandmother-friendly UI standards with 60px buttons'
      - 'Create comprehensive timeout handling (30s max)'
      - 'Implement local data encryption for client information'
    monitor:
      - 'AI service health checks every 30 seconds'
      - 'Memory usage during Mistral 7B inference'
      - 'Document generation success rates'
      - 'User completion rates vs 90% target'
      - 'Accessibility compliance with WCAG AA'
    waived:
      - 'Manual update process accepted for v1.0'
      - 'WinUI 3 compatibility issues in edge case Windows versions'

# Gate Decision: FAIL - Must address critical risks before development
gate_decision: FAIL
gate_rationale: |
  4 critical risks identified that would cause complete system failure:
  - AI dependency without fallback
  - Database corruption without recovery
  - Document generation single point of failure
  - UI complexity violating core accessibility requirements

  These must be addressed before proceeding with Epic development.

# Scoring Details
risk_score: 15  # Out of 100 (HIGH RISK)
risk_level: HIGH_RISK
critical_blocker_count: 4

# Testing Requirements
mandatory_tests:
  - AI resilience and fallback testing
  - Database corruption recovery testing
  - Document generation error handling testing
  - Accessibility testing with target demographic (50+ users)
  - Performance testing for 30-second requirement
  - Installation process validation testing

# Mitigation Timeline
immediate_actions_required:
  - Design and implement AI fallback algorithm
  - Create database backup and recovery procedures
  - Establish document generation error handling
  - Define and validate UI accessibility standards
  - Set up test infrastructure for AI service mocking
  - Create performance benchmarking framework
